# Antroid Malware Classification
Jupyter notebooks used in development of Android malware classification project.

**1. Permission-Feature-binary** : Standard neural network using Permissions for Binary classification(malware/non-malware).

**2. API_Call-Intent_Action-Softmax** : Standard neural network using API calls and Intent-Action for Multiclass classification(29 families of malware).

**3. Intent-Perm-Binary** : Standard neural network using intent-action and permissions paired together for Binary classification(malware/non-malware).

**4. Network_Traffic_Binary** : Standard neural network using network traffic features for Binary classification(malware/non-malware).

**5. Multimodal_Network_Binary** : Multimodal neural network using intent-action and permission for Binary classification(malware/non-malware).

**6. Multimodal_Network_Softmax** : Multimodal Neural Network using API calls and intent-action for Multiclass classification(29 families of malware).

**setOfAPICalls.txt** : Gives the API calls we have identified and used in the project.

**setOfIntentActions.txt** : Gives the Intent-actions we have identified and used in the project.

**setOfPermissions.txt** : Gives the Permissions we have identified and used in the project.

**setOfNetorkFeatures.txt** : Gives the network features we have identified and used in the project.
